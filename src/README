This is a brief description of each package. 

com.mark.adt  - Basic datatypes used by all the codebase. 

com.mark.data - Provides an abstraction to a grade database and means to load 
				database from different source types (Excel, CSV, JSON, Google 
				Docs, etc).
				
com.mark.learner - Classes that infer the grades each grader would give to 
				   every student on each assignment.
				   
com.mark.similarity - Given a pair of learners, these classes compute a
					  distance between them based on their grading-style 
					  similarity. 
					  
com.mark.embedding - Given a set of learners and a similarity function between
					 them, provides an approximate set of points in R^n that
					 preserves the distances between each other. 

com.mark.web - Set of RPC handlers to load and visualize grade databases 
			   identified by a unique identifier.
